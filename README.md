You can select Outpost and Survival for all maps, however the game does not support those on all maps. You will just sit on a loading screen if you select a map that doesn't support the scenario. Checkpoint Security, and Checkpoint Insurgents work for every map. You can just select another map/scenario on loading screens, so its not like you are hard locked or anything.
